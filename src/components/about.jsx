        My name is Jordan and I am a robotics engineer. I am originally from Salem, OR, but I now live in Boston. <br></br> <br></br> 
        I have a lot of experience in education, but I am now looking to transition to robotics full-time! 
        A better description of my experience and education is under the 'INV' tab, and my projects are under the 'DATA' tab. 
        Under the "VIEW" tab you can change the UI color, and view my resume.  <br></br> <br></br> 
        If the design of the website didn't give it away, I do enjoy playing videos games with one of my favorites being the 'Fallout' series 
        (of course I started another Fallout 4 playthrough after moving to Boston). 
        Aside from video games, I also enjoy playing tennis and have been playing for about 8 years now.</h1>
