                    Hello! I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science
                    from Pacific University in 2024. I'm now pursuing my Master's in Robotics and Autonomous Systems 
                    at Boston University. I am most interested in exploring multi-agent systems applications
                    in real or simulated environments.

                <p> 
                    During my time at Pacific University, I was a member of the 
                    Women in Computer Science club and, at different times, both a member 
                    and team manager of the men's tennis team. I also worked at the university 
                    help desk for three years as a computer support technician. 
                    For my senior thesis, I conducted research on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) 
                    for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Some notable courses I took 
                    include Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Mathematical Probability and Statistics, 
                    Introduction to Analysis, Introduction to Databases, and Data Structures.

                    I am in my second semester at Boston University, where I have 
                    worked on both applied and simulated robotics projects. During my 
                    first year in the program, I have completed or am currently taking 
                    courses including Robot Motion Planning, 
                    Introduction to Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Soft Robotics,
                    Learning from Data, Image and Video Processing, and Introduction to Embedded Systems.

                    I am currently a lead teacher at The Robo Hub, where I design and teach
                    robotics and programming concepts to the youth of Cambridge! In this role, 
                    I explore sensor functionality, real-world application, and efficient
                    design using robotics kits. Additionally, I help build a foundation of programming skills
                    by applying loops, events, conditionals, and functions.

                    <br>
                    Outside of my current job, I have held many other positions such as:
                    teaching assistant for a high school mechatronics program, a math and computer science tutor,
                    robotics instructor, and computer support technician.

                    I am an avid tennis player! I played D3 tennis briefly, and was an assistant coach to a
                    high school team for 3 years! I enjoy playing video games like Dark Souls. 
                    And I enjoy painting and hanging out with my family!
