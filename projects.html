            <h2>Network-Based EKF SLAM</h2>
            <p>
                This project extends and applies my senior capstone by implementing 
                EKF-SLAM on a robotic system using an Arduino, a server, and a custom Python processing pipeline. 
                Unlike traditional SLAM implementations that rely on established libraries, I am manually implementing 
                core functions to deepen my understanding of localization, mapping, and data processing. 
                This approach increases complexity but I believe will be a valuable learning experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Software</b>
                <br>
                As seen in the top image, the Arduino will transmit sensor data via WebSockets to a Python server. 
                The server will then pass the data through IPC to a Python script, which will handle sensor fusion, 
                SLAM calculations, and updating/storing the robot's position and map in a MySQL database. 
                The frontend will communicate with the database through the server via WebSockets, enabling real-time 
                updates and visualization of the robot's localization and map.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Hardware</b>
                <br>
                The hardware setup is relatively simple: an Arduino Uno R4, an ultrasonic distance sensor (28015), 
                two DC gear motors, an L298N motor driver, and an MPU-6050 gyroscope. They can be seen in the bottom image.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Challenges</b>
                <br>
                One of the challenges of this project that I believe will have a big impact is the 
                affordable hardware being used.
                The Arduino Uno R4, ultrasonic distance sensor (28015), and MPU-6050 gyroscope 
                are affordable but introduce limitations in accuracy, noise, and data reliability. 
                This will make sensor fusion and noise filtering critical to achieving stable SLAM 
                performance. Another challenge is the DC gear motors and L298N motor driver, which do 
                not provide built-in encoder feedback. This makes odometry-based localization less reliable, 
                so I plan on overcoming this using a fixed speed, and working in a step fashion. Thus, compensating for these 
                inaccuracies through software-based error correction and probabilistic filtering will be an 
                important aspect of the project. <br>
                On the software side, manually implementing EKF-SLAM without existing libraries adds 
                a ton of complexity. Efficiently handling real-time data transmission between the Arduino, 
                Python server, and frontend requires optimized WebSockets and interprocess 
                communication (IPC). Ensuring that data is processed fast enough to keep up with the 
                robot's movement will be key to maintaining a responsive system. Despite the outcome of the project,
                it will provide valuable insights into working with robotics systems while further deepening my 
                understanding of SLAM, sensor fusion, and real-time robotics software.
