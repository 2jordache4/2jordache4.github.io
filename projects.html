            <h2>Network-Based EKF SLAM</h2>
            <p>
                This project extends my senior capstone by implementing EKF-SLAM 
                on a robotic system using an Arduino, a server, and a custom Python 
                processing pipeline. Unlike traditional SLAM implementations, I'm 
                manually developing core functions for localization, mapping, 
                and data processing to deepen my understanding of these systems.

            <h2>'Blazebots' Multi-Agent Simulation</h2>
            <p>
                The Blazebots simulation was a collaborative project focused
                on simulating path planning and obstacle detection using a 
                hybrid multi-agent system. In the simulation, blue and green
                robots function as obstacle detectors, scanning
                the environment and reporting detected obstacles to a central
                system. The red robot then uses this real-time data to perform 
                optimal path planning, navigating efficiently through the environment 
                while avoiding obstacles. While there were areas for improvement, this 
                project highlights the integration of multi-agent collaboration and 
                path planning algorithms in a partially known dynamic environment.

        <h2>Senior Capstone</h2>
        <p>
            For my Math Senior Capstone, I focused on Extended Kalman 
            Filter (EKF) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), 
            an algorithm in robotics for enabling a robot to 
            map its environment and track its own location. 
            The core of my project involved deriving the mathematical formulas
            behind EKF SLAM and reverse-engineering the process to fully 
            understand the underlying principles and how each component 
            contributes to the algorithm's effectiveness.

            By working through the derivations of the prediction and update steps, 
            I was able to break down the assumptions and linear approximations that
            form the basis of the EKF approach. This in-depth analysis allowed me to 
            uncover how the algorithm balances uncertainty in both the robot's 
            location and the environment map. Through this reverse engineering,
            I gained an understanding of how EKF SLAM optimizes both
            the map-building and localization tasks in an uncertain environment.
